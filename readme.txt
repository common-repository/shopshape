the headline, while the child addons are the customizable addons options, all at the fingertips of your valued customers.

With Shop Shape, every selection matters. As customers choose their preferred addons, witness real-time changes in the
total product price with addons price. The power to customize is now in their hands, providing instant gratification as they curate their
perfect purchase. It's not just a transaction; it's an experience that keeps them engaged and satisfied.

addons prices, both in the cart and during the checkout process. The transparency creates a sense of trust, making the purchase
journey smooth and enjoyable.
